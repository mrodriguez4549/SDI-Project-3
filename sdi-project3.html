<p>I continued my story based on Project Wraith. It is a race car that is being built purposely for drag racing at this year's Fall Nationals Race Week in Texas.</p>
<p>We have been working on this car for a while now perfecting the motor combo, suspension and tuning. 
After we got the car back from the paint shop, it was time to put her together with only 40 days left. 
For those who do not know anything about drag racing, there is a lot of key elements that come in to
play before even attempting to show up and try to race. We determine weight, bracket, tire size, motor, 
suspension and chassis enhancement, inspection, license, etc. After we get everything into place, we then 
can start the tuning on the dyno to get the most power out of our setup.</p>
